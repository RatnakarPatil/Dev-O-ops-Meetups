### Venue: Blazeclan Technologies,Pune. 
### DevOps Pune Meetup : 6 


Dev - O - Ops :

### 1. Integration of GenAI in DevOps: Sourjeet Gupta - Lead data scientist at Blazeclan technologies 
 
- What if the Gen-AI can able to write a script IaC or something else for Developer. 
- It is very Important to give exact context to Ai so that it will able to understand the text / code and able to summarize the document and extracting meaning out of it. 
- Gen Ai reviews and can able to reduce the complexity and time taking jobs easily. It can automate the automating scripts.
 
> **Use of GenAi in  DevOps**:
>     1. Automating code Generation
>     2. Intelligent Code reviews
>     3. Generate test cases
>     4. Automating the automation
>     5. Real time Monitoring And anomaly Detection
>     6. Trouble shouting Infra Failure 
>     7. Suggest Remedies
>     8. Automated Incident Reporting and Response
>     9. Documentation.
 
- What Soft Eng. should do to that to learn tools of making use of this GenAi things and second thing is be ready to deal with more complexity with Ai tools.
- You are doing more work by using Ai and not loosing your job. In short it is improving your working ability and not taking off your jobs.
 
### 2. Performance engineering role in FinOps: Rameshwar Shelge Co-Found and CTO at RefactorQ.
- Performance engineering consists of Performance testing , performance tunning , performance modeling.
- Phases of Performance Engineering: 
> **Architecture review and understand the non Functional Requirement** ⇒ **Performance Modeling** ⇒ **performance  profiling** ⇒ **performance Testing** ⇒ **Analysis and Fine Tunning**  ⇒ **Performance Monitoring**


**FinOps**: It is an operational framework and cultural practice which maximize the business value of cloud, enables timely data-driven decision making and creates financial accountability through collaboration between enginnering, finanace and business teams.

- FinOps phase  Inform - Optimize - Operate
 
- Current Job Scenario ⇒ DevOps Eng. < Cloud Eng. < Platform Eng. < SR Eng.
 
- DevOps and Cloud Eng. should know that CPU and Memory are only Primary indicators but they are not only the indicators. - Rameshwar Sir

- Example Case: Suppose Someone said your product is world class and you will have 1000's of customer after 3 months and purchase 150k Dollers cluster for it but this can be run in Dollers 10k only , so your are just running out of budget due to lack of performance and FinOps Eng.
 
- You cannot archive 100% efficiency but at least u minimize the spent.


### 3. ELK Stack : Dev Duv

> ELK Stack - Self hosted Elastic Stack.

- Self-hosted Elastic vs Elastic cloud.

- Some Slippery Areas of clusters:
  > Apropriate compute
    Storage
    delivers: Hot, Warm ,Frozen
    Data Tiers

- Elastic searches can be hazardous. Attempt to fix a storage issues led to data loss incident and slow searches.
- Starting and stopping EC2 instances can led to loss of data due to impersistent storage . solution is to attach instance Storages.
 
### 4. Fiberplane + DevOops : Talk by Nele and Christiana 
- Fiberplane : Debugging infrastructure has never been so ....nice !
